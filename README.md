# The Art of War by Sun Tzu

"It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected." - Sun Tzu

The Art of War as a JSON object.


## Seeking Illustrations

I'd love to have 13 illustrations related to each chapter. The chapters are:

- Laying Plans
- Waging War
- Attack by Stratagem
- Tactical Dispositions
- Energy
- Weak Points and Strong
- Maneuvering
- Variation in Tactics
- The Army on the March
- Terrain
- The Nine Situations
- The Attack by Fire
- The Use of Spies

Ideally, these drawings will be black/white or mono chromatic. Each is simple way of illustrating these points.
